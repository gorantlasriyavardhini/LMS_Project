# LMS_Project
This is a Library Management System (LMS) built using Python for the user interface and MySQL as the backend database. The project is designed to manage and automate common library tasks such as adding books, issuing books to users, returning books, managing members, and tracking availability.

# Library Management System (LMS)

The **Library Management System** is a simple yet powerful command-line-based application developed using **Python** and **MySQL**. It is designed to help automate and manage the daily operations of a library, including handling book inventories, issuing and returning books, managing members, and maintaining records â€” all from the terminal.

This project is suitable for beginners who want to practice using Python with databases and understand how different components of a real-world system interact.
##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a basic Library Management System that can:
- Manage book details
- Manage student/faculty member details
- Allow issuing and returning of books
- Track the availability of books
- Generate simple reports

This system is ideal for small-scale libraries or as a base model for developing a more advanced system with a GUI or web-based interface.
## Tech Stack Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Library Used:** `mysql-connector-python` for connecting Python with MySQL  
- **Interface:** Command Line Interface (CLI)
  
##  Key Features Explained

Here are the key features of the LMS project:
### Book Management
- Add new books to the inventory
- Update existing book details
- Delete books from the library
- View the list of all books and their availability status
### Member Management
- Add new members (students/faculty)
- View all registered members
### Book Issuing & Returning
- Issue books to members with automatic date tracking
- Return books and update the availability
- Prevent issuing the same book if it's already issued
### Reports and Tracking
- View issued and returned books
- Check availability of books
- Maintain transaction logs for reference



The project is organized into different modules to make it modular and maintainable.
